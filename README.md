Maintenance Prediction and Driver Performance Analysis

Existing system lacks a comprehensive mechanism to monitor and address driver driving performance, leading to instances of aggressive driving, speeding, abrupt braking, and other unsafe behaviors. This jeopardizes the well-being of passengers, especially women and those with children, and compromises the overall safety of the rides provided.

In addition to passenger safety, there is also a need to ensure the well-being of drivers. The current system does not offer a robust mechanism for driver evaluation and improvement, depriving them of valuable resources and guidance to enhance their driving skills. This not only impacts their own safety but also affects their ability to provide a secure and comfortable ride for passengers.

The Smart Failure Detection system aims to leverage Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to predict maintenance needs in vehicles based on sound, vibration, temperature, and humidity data. By analysing these sensor inputs, the system will provide proactive alerts and predictions, enabling vehicle owners/device users and maintenance teams to take timely action and prevent potential breakdowns.

The successful implementation of the Smart Failure Detection system will enhance vehicle safety, reduce maintenance costs, and improve overall operational efficiency. By leveraging AI/ML techniques, the system will empower vehicle owners and maintenance teams to proactively address maintenance needs, ensuring optimal performance and extending the lifespan of vehicles.

To address passenger safety issues, we are proposing to implement an OBD device-based solution to monitor driver driving performance. By leveraging OBD technology, the aim is to track and analyze driver behavior, provide real-time feedback, offer coaching and training opportunities, assess driver risk levels, and promote responsible driving habits. This solution will enhance ride safety for all users, instill confidence in passengers, and establish a framework for continuous improvement in driver performance and accountability.
